#Continous Integration
Continuous Integration is a development practice where developers put their code in a common shared repository, multiple times during the course of the working day. The integrated code is verified automatically to check for errors each time the code is integrated. This gives the developers an opportunity to fix errors as soon as they occur during integration, before multiple features are integrated the final product. One tool that has been mentioned is GITLAb CI which has GitLab runners that process builds.
